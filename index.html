        1Ex Works <br><i>Ex Works (EXW) is an international trade term that describes </i><br>when a seller makes a product
         available at a designated location, and the buyer of the product must cover the transport costs. Ex Works (EXW) is one of the 
         11 current Incoterms (International Commercial Terms), a set of standardized international trade terms published by the
          International Chamber of Commerce. 1Ex Works (EXW) requires a seller to safely package goods, label them appropriately, 
          <br>and deliver them to a previously agreed-upon location, such as the seller's nearest port. The seller must also help
           the buyer get export licenses or other required paperwork, although the buyer must pay the actual fees for the documents
        .Once the buyer has the goods, it is up to the buyer to cover any expenses and account for any risks that pertain to the goods.
         <br>Risks could include loading the products onto a truck,<mark>transferring them to a ship or plane, dealing with customs officials, 
            unloading them at their destination, and storing or reselling them.</mark>  Even if the <del>seller helps the buyer by loading the product onto</del>
          a ship, it's still up to the buyer to pay if anything goes wrong during the loading.</p>
